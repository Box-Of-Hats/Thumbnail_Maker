# Thumbnail Maker

## Motivation
My father makes YouTube videos and often found that he couldn't use his photographs as thumbnails as they were too large in size.There were solutions available to compress images but they were all too complex for him to use. This application was designed to make it easy for people to create their own simple thumbnails that comply with YouTube's size constraints as well as providing a basic graphical user interface.
